* @description
* CWE: 191 Integer Underflow
* BadSource: rand Set data to result of rand()
* GoodSource: A hardcoded non-zero, non-min, non-max, even number
* Sinks: multiply
*    GoodSink: Ensure there will not be an underflow before multiplying data by 2
*    BadSink : If data is negative, multiply by 2, which can cause an underflow
* Flow Variant: 06 Control flow: if(PRIVATE_STATIC_FINAL_FIVE==5) and if(PRIVATE_STATIC_FINAL_FIVE!=5)
